<td>To set up your web site, use the following startup guide:
<ol>
  <li><b>Select A Theme: </b>Choose the &quot;Template&quot; link to the left to select one of our pre-installed templates. Or, enter your own HTML code for a customized
    design.</li>
  <li><b>Add Pages:</b> Choose the &quot;Pages&quot; link to the left to select the pages you'd like to appear on your site.</li>
  <li><b>Add Store Categories:</b> Choose the &quot;Categories&quot; link to the left to start entering some categories to your online store. Use the arrow icons to move
    the categories' positions as they will appear on your site. You can set up to three levels of categories (main category &gt; subcategory &gt; end category).</li>
  <li><b>Add Products:</b> Once your categories have been entered, choose the &quot;Products&quot; link to the left to start adding products. Add or edit products singly
    to modify all details, or edit the main points and modify up to 10 items at once. You can also upload text files of products if desired.</li>
  <li><b>Change Settings</b>: Choose the &quot;Site Settings&quot; link to the right to update main site variables. Choose the &quot;Fonts &amp; Colors&quot; link to
    update color values (if you are not using your own CSS file). Choose the &quot;Catalog Setup&quot; link to modify all shopping catalog variables as needed.</li>
  <li><b>Add Additional Features:</b> If you want to add additional functionality to your web site, such as a gift registry, affiliate program, guest book, link page,
    event calendar, wholesale catalog, articles, frequently asked question list, gift certificates, order tracking or coupons, select the appropriate link and use the
    help screens to set up the feature. All additional features are optional and can be turned off.</li>
  <li><b>Back Up Your Data:</b> Periodically, especially after making many changes or adding several products, you should back up your database. Use the
    &quot;Backup&quot; link to create a database dump copy. Save the file on your hard drive, then delete the file from your web site so that it is not visible to others.</li>
